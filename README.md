# BuzzEireBrazil


This blog, aptly named "Buzz Eire Brazil," was conceived with a mission to serve Brazilians living in Ireland. Designed to attract both those looking to establish and promote their business ventures and those interested in connecting with these enterprises, the platform serves as a bridge between small entrepreneurs and their target audience. Whether you're a seasoned resident or a newcomer seeking to understand the market landscape, our blog offers insights, recommendations, and opportunities tailored for you.

"Buzz" in the blog's name captures the essence of conversation and engagement. "Eire" nods to our Irish setting, while "Brazil" honors the community we primarily serve. Together, these elements represent the triad of communication, location, and community.

The user-friendly layout, designed for accessibility across all age groups, underscores our commitment to inclusivity. Its simplicity is deliberate, signaling that this is the inaugural version of our platform. We're in a dynamic phase of growth and anticipate introducing new tools, layouts, colors, and sections in the near future. Our chosen color scheme further establishes our niche, providing a warm and welcoming environment for Brazilians in Ireland, whether they're longtime residents or recent arrivals.

Ultimately, our goal is to foster connections and open doors—whether you're looking to promote your business, discover professional services, or simply seeking recommendations within the Brazilian community in Ireland. We are here to support and facilitate these interactions, empowering our community with resources and opportunities.

<summary> Agile</summary>
Agile methodologies have been employed to manage and prioritize project tasks using GitHub Project Boards. Here's how we approached it:

1. **Theme Identification:** Initially, we created a spreadsheet to collect details categorized by themes, which helped us define epics. These themes include Account Management, Profile, Post Pool, Navigation, and Admin.

2. **Issue Template:** To expedite the addition of User Stories to the project, we developed an issue template.

3. **Repository Settings:** In the repository settings, we set up templates for features. The Issue Template provides developers with the necessary information to address MVP (Minimum Viable Product) points.

4. **Deployment process:** The project was developed using python and Django and was deployed using Debug = `False`

<summary> User Story Prioritization - MoSCoW Method</summary>

<br>

In order to work and decide what task I would implement first and what task I could leave under an "if" categorie I applied the agile MoSCoW methodology

<br>

- Must-have: Essential requirements that the project must deliver.
- Should-have: Important but not essential; can be postponed if necessary.
- Could-have: Desirable but not necessary; can be delayed or omitted.
- Won't-have this time: Recognized as not being necessary for this delivery but could be considered in the future.

Within our development cycle, user stories are prioritized using the MoSCoW approach. Below is an outline of our current sprint's story allocation:

<br>

| Priority       | User Story                                               | Story Points |

| Must-have      | Content Administration                                   |Check             |
| Must-have      | Access a Post                                            |Check             |
| Must-have      | Engage with Content                                      |Check             |
| Must-have      | Participate in Post Discussion                           |Check             |

<summary>Typography Evolution in Our Blog</summary>

<br>

In the initial stages of our blog design, we adopted the "Secular One" font. It had a unique flair and gave our content a distinct identity. However, as we pondered the direction and growth trajectory of our blog, we felt a need for something more foundational.

We've chosen to transition to "sans-serif" for our current version. This decision stems not from a desire for simplicity, but rather from a strategic perspective. Many iconic platforms begin with a foundational aesthetic, progressively building upon it to carve out a unique identity. Adopting a basic font at this juncture gives us the flexibility and space to evolve, signaling to our audience that this is just the beginning. We're in a phase of continuous improvement and growth.

Our typography change is symbolic. It reflects our commitment to refinement and our openness to adaptation based on user feedback and emerging design trends. In essence, we're laying the groundwork for future implementations, fostering the idea that our platform is ever-evolving and always striving for excellence.

<summary>Future implementation </summary>



 1. List of Posts Sorted by Categories:
In upcoming versions, we will introduce a feature to categorize posts. This will make it easier for users to find content that interests them. Posts will be tagged with relevant categories, and users can filter posts by selecting a category from the navigation menu.

2. Search Bar on the Top of Post List:
To enhance user experience, we'll add a search bar at the top of the post list. Users can simply enter keywords or phrases related to their interests, and the system will display matching posts in real-time.

 3. Reply for Suggestions in Suggestion Section:
We are committed to fostering engagement within the community. In the next release, users will be able to reply to suggestions, providing feedback or offering assistance. This will create a more interactive and supportive environment.

 4. Reply for Comments in Post Details:
To encourage discussions, we will implement a comment reply feature. Users can respond to specific comments within a post's comment section, facilitating meaningful conversations.

 5. Rate with Star for Services in Post Details:
We aim to improve the way users evaluate services. Users will have the option to rate services with a star-based system, offering valuable feedback to service providers and helping other users make informed decisions.

 6. Feed with Updates in Another Page Like a Journal:
In future updates, we will introduce a dedicated page for updates and announcements. Users can access this journal-like feed to stay informed about the latest community news, events, and changes to the platform.

 7. Notification Preferences for User:
Personalization is key. Users will be able to customize their notification preferences. They can choose to receive updates related to specific categories, new posts, comments on their content, and more.

 8. Reset Password:
Password management is crucial. Users will have the option to reset their passwords securely through a password reset feature. This ensures account security and accessibility.

 9. Draft Post for Keeping Posts Saved:
We understand that not every post is meant for immediate publishing. Users can save drafts of their posts and return to them later for editing and publishing. This feature will ensure that no creative idea is lost.

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Accessibility</summary>


Our commitment to accessibility is evident in every line of code. We've gone the extra mile to make our website as user-friendly as possible for everyone. Here's how we've achieved this:

- Semantic HTML: We've meticulously crafted our web pages using semantic HTML tags. This means that not only is our code clean and organized, but it also ensures that screen readers and assistive technologies can understand and navigate the content effortlessly.

- Descriptive Alt Attributes: Images on our site are more than just visuals; they're informative. We've provided detailed and meaningful alt attributes for every image. This empowers screen readers to convey the content accurately to users who rely on them.

- Icons with Text Descriptions: Icons can be confusing for some users. To make sure everyone understands their meaning, we've included text descriptions alongside icons where needed. This ensures that all users, regardless of their abilities, can interact with our site effectively.

- Color Contrast: We understand the importance of legibility. To that end, we've maintained a high level of color contrast throughout our site. This not only makes text and content easier to read but also ensures that our site is inclusive and accessible to all.

At BuzzEireBrazil, accessibility isn't an afterthought; it's an integral part of our development process. We believe that everyone should have a seamless and enjoyable experience on our platform, regardless of their abilities or assistive technologies.

```

8. Add Heroku Buildpacks
Heroku uses buildpacks to determine how to build and run your application. You'll need to add Python and Node.js buildpacks if your project uses JavaScript or CSS. Run the following commands to add buildpacks:
```
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/python
```
9. Set Environment Variables

Set the environment variables in Heroku that you mentioned earlier. You can do this by running:
```
heroku config:set CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_api_key
heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key 
```

Replace your_cloudinary_api_key, your_database_url, and your_secret_key with your actual keys and URLs.

10. Deploy to Heroku

Now it's time to deploy your project to Heroku. Run:
``` 
git push heroku master
```

This command will push your code to Heroku's servers and trigger the deployment process.

11. Run Migrations

After deploying, run the following command to apply database migrations:
``` 
heroku run python manage.py migrate 
```

12. Open Your App

Your app should be deployed and live on Heroku now! You can open it in your browser using
``` 
heroku open
```

<summary>Automated Tests </summary>



### Automated testing scripts have been employed to streamline our testing process, resulting in consistent and efficient testing outcomes. We ran tests for Models.py, Views.py and Forms.py in three differents files. 



## Forms Validation Tests

## 1. test_post_form_valid_data
#### Purpose: 
This test checks if the form for creating a post can tell when you give it the right information.
#### How It Works: 
It pretends to fill out the form with the correct info, like a post title and content. Then, it checks if the form thinks everything is good (valid).
#### Result We Want:
 We hope this test passes, which means the form knows when you're giving it the right details.


## 2. test_comment_form_valid_data


#### Purpose: 
This test checks if the form for making comments can recognize when you provide the right data.
#### How It Works:
 It pretends to fill out the comment form with proper information, like the comment text. Then, it checks if the form says everything is okay (valid).
#### Result We Want:
 We expect this test to pass, showing that the comment form can tell when you're giving it the right data.



## 3. test_user_suggestion_form_valid_data


#### Purpose: 
This test checks if the form for user suggestions can tell when you provide it with the correct details.
#### How It Works:
 It pretends to fill out the suggestion form with good data, like the suggestion text. Then, it checks if the form thinks it's all right (valid).
#### Result We Want:
 We want this test to pass, meaning the suggestion form can recognize when you're giving it the right information.


## 4. test_sponsorship_contact_form_valid_data
#### Purpose:
 This test checks if the form for sponsorship contact can recognize when you give it the right info.
#### How It Works:
 It pretends to fill out the sponsorship contact form with proper data, like the name and email. Then, it checks if the form believes everything is fine (valid).
#### Result We Want:
 We anticipate this test to pass, showing that the sponsorship contact form can identify when you're providing the right information.

![Test Form.py](documentation/tests_form.PNG)

<br>


## Models Validation Tests

## 1. test_title_max_length

### Purpose:
 This test checks if the title of a post can't be too long.
#### How It Works:
 It pretends to create a post with an extra-long title and then sees if the title is as long as it should be.
#### Result We Want:
 We hope this test passes, which means our posts have a limit on how long their titles can be.

## 2. test_object_name_is_title
#### 
Purpose: This test checks if the name of a post object is the same as its title.
#### How It Works:
 It pretends to create a post and then compares the post's name to what the title should be.
##### Result We Want:
 We expect this test to pass, showing that our posts have their names set to their titles.

## Disclaimer:
For the installation and initial setup of this project, we drew inspiration from two valuable resources:

1. The "I think therefore I blog" project from Code Institute.
2. The tutorial on building a blog application with Django available at Django Central.
These resources provided foundational insights and guidance in implementing key features of our project. While we have customized and expanded upon these foundations to meet the specific needs of our platform, we acknowledge and appreciate the contribution of these resources to our development process. We thank Code Institute and Django Central for sharing their knowledge and making it accessible to the developer community.
